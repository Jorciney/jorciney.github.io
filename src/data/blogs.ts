    excerpt: 'Learn how to implement Module Federation architecture to improve deployment cycles and team autonomy across multiple frontend teams.',
    content: `
      Module Federation has revolutionized how we build and deploy micro-frontends. In this post, I'll share insights from implementing this architecture at Telenet.

      ## Why Module Federation?

      Traditional monolithic frontends face several challenges:
      - Long deployment cycles
      - Team dependencies
      - Difficult to scale
      - Technology lock-in

      Module Federation addresses these issues by allowing teams to develop and deploy independently while sharing code at runtime.

      ## Key Benefits

      1. **Independent Deployments**: Teams can deploy their modules without affecting others
      2. **Shared Dependencies**: Reduce bundle size by sharing common libraries
      3. **Technology Flexibility**: Different teams can use different versions of frameworks
      4. **Better Team Autonomy**: Teams own their entire vertical slice

      ## Implementation Strategy

      The key to successful implementation is careful planning of module boundaries and shared contracts...

    title: 'WordPress Performance Optimization: From 5s to Sub-1s Load Times',
    excerpt: 'A comprehensive guide to optimizing WordPress websites for lightning-fast performance, including practical tips and real-world examples.',
    content: `
      Performance is crucial for user experience and SEO. Here's how I optimized multiple WordPress sites to achieve sub-second load times.

      ## The Performance Challenge

      Most WordPress sites suffer from:
      - Bloated themes and plugins
      - Unoptimized images
      - Excessive database queries
      - Poor caching strategies

      ## Optimization Techniques

      ### 1. Image Optimization
      - Implement lazy loading
      - Use WebP format with fallbacks
      - Properly size images for different viewports

      ### 2. Caching Strategy
      - Browser caching
      - Page caching
      - Object caching
      - CDN integration

      ### 3. Database Optimization
      - Clean up post revisions
      - Optimize database tables
      - Implement query caching

      ### 4. Code Optimization
      - Minify CSS and JavaScript
      - Eliminate render-blocking resources
      - Reduce HTTP requests

      ## Results

      After implementing these optimizations on CleverUpps Marketing website, we achieved:
      - 85% reduction in load time
      - 95+ PageSpeed score
      - 40% increase in conversions

    excerpt: 'A detailed guide on migrating large-scale applications from Angular to React, including common pitfalls and best practices.',
    content: `
      While both Angular and React are excellent frameworks, sometimes business needs require migration. Here's what I learned from recent migration projects.

      ## Planning the Migration

      ### Assessment Phase
      - Audit existing functionality
      - Identify shared components
      - Map out dependencies
      - Create migration roadmap

      ### Incremental Approach
      - Start with leaf components
      - Use a strangler fig pattern
      - Maintain both systems temporarily
      - Gradual feature migration

      ## Technical Considerations

      ### State Management
      - Moving from Services to Context/Redux
      - Handling async operations
      - Managing side effects

      ### Routing
      - Angular Router to React Router
      - Preserving deep links
      - Handling guards and resolvers

      ## Key Takeaways

      1. Don't rush the migration
      2. Invest in automated testing
      3. Keep the team trained
      4. Document everything

      - Perfect for content sites
      - Excellent performance

      ### Hybrid Approach
      - SSG for static content
      - SSR for dynamic pages
      - Client-side for interactions

      ## Implementation Tips

      1. Use semantic HTML
      2. Implement structured data
      3. Optimize Core Web Vitals
      4. Create XML sitemaps
      5. Use canonical URLs
