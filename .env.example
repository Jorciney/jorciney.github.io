# Raindrop.io API Configuration
# 
# IMPORTANT: This integration requires a valid API token from Raindrop.io
#
# How to get your token (from official docs):
# 1. Go to https://app.raindrop.io/settings/integrations
# 2. Create a new "App":
#    - App Name: "Personal Portfolio" (or any name)
#    - Description: "Personal website bookmarks integration"  
#    - Redirect URI: "http://localhost:3008" (or your domain)
# 3. After creating, open your application settings
# 4. Copy the "Test Token" (should be 36 characters, format: xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx)
# 5. The token works only for your personal account data
#
# Alternative: Export bookmarks as JSON and use static data
# If API integration doesn't work, you can:
# 1. Go to https://app.raindrop.io/settings/backups
# 2. Export your bookmarks as JSON
# 3. Replace the mockBookmarks array in src/lib/raindrop.ts
#
RAINDROP_TOKEN=your_36_character_test_token_here

# Optional: Specific collection ID to fetch (defaults to 0 for all unsorted bookmarks)
# You can find collection IDs in the Raindrop.io app URL when viewing a collection
RAINDROP_COLLECTION_ID=0

# Debug: Set to true to enable detailed API logging
DEBUG_RAINDROP=false
