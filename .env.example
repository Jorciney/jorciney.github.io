# Raindrop.io API Configuration
# 
# IMPORTANT: This integration requires a valid API token from Raindrop.io
#
# How to get your token:
# 1. Go to https://app.raindrop.io/settings/integrations
# 2. Create a new "App" (not just test token)
# 3. For "App Name" use something like "Personal Portfolio"
# 4. For "Description" use "Personal website bookmarks integration"
# 5. For "Redirect URI" use "http://localhost:3008" or your domain
# 6. After creating, copy the "Test Token" (36 characters long)
#
# Alternative: Export bookmarks as JSON and use static data
# If API integration doesn't work, you can:
# 1. Go to https://app.raindrop.io/settings/backups
# 2. Export your bookmarks as JSON
# 3. Replace the mockBookmarks array in src/lib/raindrop.ts
#
RAINDROP_TOKEN=your_36_character_test_token_here

# Optional: Specific collection ID to fetch (defaults to 0 for all unsorted bookmarks)
# You can find collection IDs in the Raindrop.io app URL when viewing a collection
RAINDROP_COLLECTION_ID=0

# Debug: Set to true to enable detailed API logging
